Samsara Vehicle Allocation to Job

Job truck charges are allocated from overhead to specific jobs based on the Samsara GPS on-site location. 

Time-on-Site reports are downloaded by month per job within Samsara. These reports are combined and used to allocate a percentage, up to 100%, of the truck’s costs.

Billing Allocation Methodology
Days in a month = 21 days
Truck billing allocation is based on:
1.	If the truck is at 4 or more jobs, the total is allocated to Overhead.
2.	When a truck is at any job for 4 or more hours, it is counted as a full business day.
3.	If the truck has been at any job for 15 or more business days > 100% allocation
4.	Trucks that don’t meet the above criteria, allocation is a percentage of total business days on job divided by 21 days.
