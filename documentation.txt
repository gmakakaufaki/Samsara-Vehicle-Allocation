Samsara Vehicle Allocation to Job

Job truck charges are allocated from overhead to specific jobs based on the Samsara GPS on-site location. 

Time-on-Site reports are downloaded by month per job within Samsara. These reports are combined and used to allocate a percentage, up to 100%, of the truck’s costs.

Python Code:
    The file names are saved to folder. The file name needs to be truncated before running. Use rename_file script to rename the file
    Update the output_folder_path and input_folder_path before running
    After the file is created, notify Brittany Moreno to complete with invoices


Reports needed to support completion:
1.	JC Detail – Used to gather the percentage used to allocate repairs and maintenance total costs 
        i.	Job – 1OH
        ii.	Phases: 31.    .
2.	JC Jobs – used to gather the job names for the report
3.	EM Equipment List – used to get the vehicle type by asset ID
4.	Master Auto List – Used to pull the current driver’s name
5.	Samsara Fuel and Energy Report – Used to calculate the assets fuel total


Billing Allocation Methodology
Days in a month = 21 days

Truck billing allocation is based on:
1.	If the truck is at 4 or more jobs, the total is allocated to Overhead.
2.	When a truck is at any job for 4 or more hours, it is counted as a full business day.
3.	If the truck has been at any job for 15 or more business days > 100% allocation
4.	Trucks that don’t meet the above criteria, allocation is a percentage of total business days on job divided by 21 days.
